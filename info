# Rheumors Referral Guidelines (Dr. Henry Averns)

These guidelines outline key rheumatologic conditions with history and investigations useful prior to referral. Not exhaustive, but helpful for triage. Urgent referrals should be phoned or faxed — expect a response within 24 hours.

## Acute Single Joint

### Septic Arthritis
- **Signs**: Acute hot red joint, very painful; systemic illness, usually fever; septic prosthesis may be silent; immunosuppression can mask symptoms.
- **Investigation Needed**: Urgent aspiration of the joint for microscopy.
- **Action**: Urgent referral to ER within 24 hrs. Phone if clinic consultation is needed.

### Gout / Pseudogout
- **Signs**: May resemble sepsis without gout history; aspiration is definitive.
- **Typical pseudogout**: Elderly woman with hot red wrist/knee.
- **Treatment**: Rest, NSAIDs (if GI risk tolerated), joint injection; colchicine for gout (many patients poorly tolerate).
- **Notes**:
  - Normal uric acid does not exclude gout.
  - High uric acid is common.
  - Allopurinol targets <350 μmol/L uric acid, but flares may continue for 1–2 years after reaching goal.
- **Action**: Urgent referral if sepsis is possible; otherwise, phone for urgent clinic review.

### Reactive Arthritis / Psoriatic Arthritis
- **Signs**: Mono/oligoarthritis; inflamed joints without pronounced redness.
- **History Check**: Inflammatory bowel disease, iritis, psoriasis, sexual history, tick exposure.
- **Action**: Semi-urgent referral; proactive investigations — CBC, U&E, LFT, CRP, ESR.

### Rare Causes (Haemarthrosis, Avascular Necrosis, Sarcoidosis)
- **Signs**: Consider sarcoidosis if erythema nodosum present.
- **Action**: Investigations as above, plus CXR if sarcoidosis is suspected.

## Sub-Acute Single/Few Joints

### Osteoarthritis
- **Signs**: Diagnosed clinically via history/exam.
- **Management**: Self-management, education; physio/OT helpful.
- **Action**: Refer only for diagnostic uncertainty or considering intra-articular injection.

### Chronic Gout
- **Signs**: Recurrent acute attacks, tophi.
- **Treatment Considerations**:
  - Allopurinol indicated.
  - Risk of continued flares post-allopurinol initiation.
- **Action**: Refer if disease control is poor, diagnosis uncertain, or renal disease present.
- **Investigations**: CBC, ESR, CRP, creatinine, LFTs, uric acid.

## Inflammatory Polyarthritis

### Rheumatoid Arthritis
- **Signs**: Persistent (>6 weeks) symmetrical synovitis, morning stiffness, malaise.
- **Labs**:
  - RF not diagnostic—used for prognosis.
  - Anti-CCP: highly specific (95–98%).
- **Referral Pathway**: Weekly early-RA clinic; urgent referrals prioritized if labeled.
- **Pre-Referral Investigations**: CBC, U&E, LFT, CRP, ESR, anti-CCP, RF, CXR, hand/feet X-rays.

### RA Flare
- **Management Advice**: Watchful waiting for a few weeks before modifying DMARDs.
- **Intervention**: Depomedrol 80 mg IM for persistent flare.
- **Action**: Phone/fax to request urgent review.

### Reactive Arthritis
- **See:** Reactive arthritis section above.
- **Investigations:** Same as inflammatory polyarthritis.
- **Note**: Consider Chlamydia testing.

### SLE / Connective Tissue Diseases
- **Action**: Contact for triage guidance.
- **Investigations**: ANA, ENA, CBC, renal function, LFT, ESR, CRP, urinalysis, CXR.

### Post-Viral Arthritis
- **Management**: Symptomatic treatment (NSAIDs); avoid steroids early.
- **Action**: Phone to discuss if concerned; Early RA clinic referral possible.

## Other Rheumatology Conditions

### Polymyalgia Rheumatica
- **Investigations**: Same as RA — CBC, U&E, LFT, CRP, ESR, anti-CCP, RF, CXR, hand/feet X-rays.
- **Action**: Urgent referral as per RA pathway.

### Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA)
- **Signs**: Systemic illness features prompting ophthalmology consult.
- **Resources**: Temporal artery ultrasound (consult required for billing); OTN available.
- **Action**: Phone/fax specifying urgent review.
- **Scoring Tool**: See PubMed 32994361.
